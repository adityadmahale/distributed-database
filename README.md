Developed a distributed database management system with various components usually available in any distributed DBMS such as management of the global and local metadata, secure and efficient storage of the data, easy retrieval of the data values, authentication for users, logging of transactions/events, a transaction manager, and query executor module, data analytics, data, and structure exporter, etc. Created a multi-site processing and multi-site data storage Distributed DBMS using Java programming, Jsch library for connections between hosts, and AWS virtual machines to simulate the two different hosts.

A distributed database is a collection of multiple databases that are interconnected over a digital
network and do not share any physical components. The DDBMS to be created was expected to allow users to register into the DBMS while following
certain security measures like encrypting the credentials, then login to the application, and then;
execute common SQL queries and perform transactions, exporting the data and the table
structures via an export/create dump function, check the analytics of the system per user i.e. count
how many queries a user performed and of which type, and to generate an ERD based on the tables
and the database structures in the system.
